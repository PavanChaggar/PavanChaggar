### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a DPhil student at the Mathematical Institute and Wellcome Trust Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, University of Oxford, supervised by [Prof. Alain Goriely](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/alain.goriely) and [Prof. Saad Jbabdi](https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~saad/).

I am working on mathematical models of neurodegeneration, specifically, Alzheimer's Disease. My work is multiscale, ranging from mechanistic ODE modelling, connectome modelling, brain imaging forward modelling and Bayesian inference. 

Previous research/education:
* 2018 - 2019, MSc Neuroscience, University College London. 
    * Supervisors: Prof. Maria Chait, Prof. Karl Friston, Prof. Gareth Barnes.
    * Thesis: Brain mechanisms underlying the detection of patterns in rapid sound sequences: Hippocampal recruitment by a temporo-frontal network supports statistical learning in humans
* 2012 - 2016, BSc Biomedical Sciences, King's College London. 
    * Supervisors: Prof. Clive Coen.
    * Thesis: The Evolution and Neurobiology of Romantic Love and Pair Bonding
