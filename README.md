I am currently a DPhil student at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, supervised by [Prof. Alain Goriely](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/alain.goriely) and [Prof. Saad Jbabdi](https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~saad/).

I am working on mathematical models of neurodegeneration, specifically, Alzheimer's Disease. My work is very interdisciplinary and includes mechanistic modelling, Bayesian inference and brain image analysis.
